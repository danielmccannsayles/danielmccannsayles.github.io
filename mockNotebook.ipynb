    "Some things I considered doing but didn’t get around to were:\n",
    "1. Adding keywords that could create new notes, or give the context of the previous x lines of notes to ChatGPT, along with a command to format it in some way.\n",
    "2. More generally, giving more options to ChatGPT - e.g. searching, or custom function calling. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    > Tech stacks are just *tools* that allow you to do *things*. Doing *things* is what’s important. \n",
    "2. I didn’t have a measurable goal for this prototype stage - \n",
    "    1. As I mentioned above, the stage I reached was not super helpful to me, which meant I wasn't able to validate this project super well. \n",
    "    2. It’s important to build in measurable outcomes to prototype stages - how can I validate if this idea is *worth continuing*? What value can I derive from *each stage*\n",
