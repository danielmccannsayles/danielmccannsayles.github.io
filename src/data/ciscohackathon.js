      content: `I competed in an internal Cisco hackathon to explore how we could improve customer experience use cases with AI. 

*My team won 1st place out of over 20 teams!*

The competition took place over the span of two weeks. It was hosted by a different organization in Cisco, so it was different products and a different setting than I was used to.

I played a few key roles on the team: 
1. Collaborating closely with our team lead to hash out his ideas and customer knowledge, and come up with a winning idea. He has a lot of knowledge around the specific field; *together* we were able to turn this into an implementation. 
2. Executing on this; I quickly learned how to build, and built, a smart AI assistant using Streamlit and a RAG system with FAISS and LangChain.

This showcases my holistic skill set. I'm at my best when I have the ability to work closely with the product, with stakeholders, and with the implementation itself!

My team lead graciously said this about me:

> "Daniel continuously demonstrated his ability to navigate high-level business strategy and translate that into ideas, concepts, code, and connections that support the achievement of those goals."

Overall, I had a lot of fun meeting people, collaborating, and creating our project.`,
