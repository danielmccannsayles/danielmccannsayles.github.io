  summary: "A Cisco Hackathon, exploring generative AI, that my team won!",
  description: `I competed in an internal Cisco hackathon exploring how to improve customer experience use cases with AI. My team won 1st place out of over 20 teams!

The competition spanned two weeks and was hosted by a different Cisco organization, exposing me to different products and settings than I was used to.

I played several key roles on the team: collaborating closely with our team lead to hash out ideas and transform his customer knowledge into winning implementation, and executing by quickly learning to build a smart AI assistant using Streamlit with a RAG system using FAISS and LangChain.

This project showcases my holistic skill set - I'm at my best when I can work closely with the product, stakeholders, and implementation itself. The combination of technical execution and strategic collaboration proved effective.

Technical implementation included building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using FAISS for vector similarity search, LangChain for LLM orchestration and document processing, Streamlit for rapid prototyping and user interface, and integration with Cisco's internal systems and data sources.

The AI assistant could understand customer queries, retrieve relevant information from internal knowledge bases, generate contextually appropriate responses, and provide actionable recommendations for customer experience improvements.

Key technical challenges included processing and vectorizing large amounts of internal documentation, optimizing retrieval accuracy and speed, designing intuitive user interfaces for non-technical stakeholders, and ensuring system reliability and performance.

My team lead graciously said: "Daniel continuously demonstrated his ability to navigate high-level business strategy and translate that into ideas, concepts, code, and connections that support the achievement of those goals."

The project demonstrated the power of combining domain expertise with rapid technical implementation. The two-week timeline required efficient learning, quick decision-making, and effective collaboration.

Unfortunately I have no code I'm allowed to share, but the experience reinforced my enjoyment of meeting people, collaborating across disciplines, and creating solutions that directly impact customer experience.

Technologies used: LangChain, FAISS, RAG architecture, Streamlit for rapid prototyping.

This win validated my approach of combining technical skills with business understanding to create practical, impactful solutions.`,
