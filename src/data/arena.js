I originally planned to complete the course, but decided to pivot after the first chapter.
    
My work can be seen on [github](https://github.com/danielmccannsayles/my-arena) 

I found this very helpful to shore up my fundamental knowledge of Tensors, Pytorch, and Neural networks and the training process (optimization, backprop, etc.). 

I really like the focus on implementing everything myself. It was hard, but rewarding, and I have a lot more confidence when doing ML projects/working with pytorch, and much more context when reading AI research.`,
