      content: `Motivation:
1. I sometimes see or participate in arguments where, upon reflection, the things being argued about are not actually the main cruxes. 
2. I also would like to explore other ways of thinking by playing around with things. 
3. Finally, I tend do be a visual thinker, so I wanted to explore making something visual like this. 

The project is up and running! Check it out here:

TODO: bring some code here, show some fun images, talk more about this. `,
