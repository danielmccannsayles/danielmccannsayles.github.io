## About

I've been working with jupyter notebooks a lot as I've done more with python and ML.

I enjoy notebooks UX - it's nice having seperate sections for different pieces of code, the ability to run those sections individually or in order, and the ability to toggle information on and off the screen.

I wanted to recreate the look of my VSCode theme - `Default Dark Modern`.

The colors are accurate. I gave up on styling the code sections exactly the same ( this required me to set up a python script & copy/paste generated HTML sections). Instead I switched to `highlight.js`, using the Atom theme, which allows me to use markdown in Svelte & renders it at runtime.

I started with HTML + JS then switched to Svelte when I was copying hundreds of lines of boilerplate and managing state for toggled sections every time I added something new.
